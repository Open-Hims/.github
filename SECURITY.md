# Security Policy

## Overview

**OpenHIMS** is healthcare infrastructure software handling sensitive Protected Health Information (PHI). We take security seriously and appreciate the security research community's help in keeping our users safe.

This document outlines our security vulnerability reporting process and security practices.

---

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          | End of Support |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------- |
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             | TBD            |
| 0.9.x   | ‚úÖ Yes (until 1.2) | March 2026     |
| 0.8.x   | ‚ö†Ô∏è Security only   | December 2025  |
| < 0.8   | ‚ùå No              | Ended          |

### Support Policy

- **Current Major Version**: Full support (features + security)
- **Previous Major Version**: Security updates for 6 months after new major release
- **Critical Healthcare Vulnerabilities**: Backported to all versions still in production use (best effort)

---

## Healthcare Threat Model

OpenHIMS operates in a high-risk environment where vulnerabilities can impact:

- **Patient Safety**: Corrupted medical data could lead to misdiagnosis or wrong treatment
- **Privacy**: Unauthorized PHI access violates HIPAA and patient trust
- **Availability**: Healthcare systems require high uptime
- **Integrity**: Medical records must be tamper-proof

### Critical Vulnerability Classifications

We use a healthcare-specific severity matrix:

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **P0 - Critical** | PHI exposure, RCE, authentication bypass | 24 hours |
| **P1 - High** | DoS, privilege escalation, data corruption | 72 hours |
| **P2 - Medium** | Information disclosure, minor data leaks | 7 days |
| **P3 - Low** | Theoretical issues, no immediate exploit | 30 days |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### üîí Responsible Disclosure

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. Instead, use one of our secure reporting channels:

### Reporting Channels

#### 1. **GitHub Security Advisory** (Preferred)

Report privately via: [https://github.com/openhims/rustcare-engine/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/openhims/rustcare-engine/security/advisories/new)

#### 2. **Email**

Send encrypted email to: **security@openhims.org**

**PGP Key**: Available at https://openhims.org/security-pgp.asc

```
Key ID: 0xABCD1234
Fingerprint: 1234 5678 9ABC DEF0 1234 5678 9ABC DEF0 1234 5678
```

#### 3. **Security Hotline** (Critical Issues Only)

For P0 vulnerabilities actively being exploited:
- Phone: +1-XXX-XXX-XXXX (24/7)
- Signal: Available upon request

## What to Include in Your Report

A good security report includes:

### Required Information

- **Summary**: Brief description of the vulnerability
- **Vulnerability Type**: RCE, SQLi, XSS, auth bypass, etc.
- **Severity Assessment**: Your estimate (P0-P3)
- **Affected Component**: Core, plugin, specific module
- **Affected Versions**: Which versions are vulnerable
- **Proof of Concept**: Steps to reproduce
- **Impact Analysis**: What can an attacker do?

### Optional but Helpful

- Suggested fix or mitigation
- Whether this is already publicly known
- If you plan to publish research (and when)
- CVE ID if already assigned

### Example Report

```markdown
## Summary
Authentication bypass in FHIR API endpoint allows unauthenticated access to patient records.

## Severity
P0 - Critical (PHI exposure)

## Affected Versions
- 1.0.0 through 1.2.3
- 0.9.x all versions

## Component
rustcare-fhir/src/api/auth.rs

## Proof of Concept
1. Send GET request to /fhir/Patient without Authorization header
2. Add header: X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
3. Receive full patient list response

## Impact
Remote attacker can access all patient records without authentication.

## Suggested Fix
Validate X-Forwarded-For header or remove trusted proxy bypass logic.
```

## Response Process

### What to Expect

1. **Acknowledgment** (24-48 hours)
   - Confirmation of receipt
   - Initial severity assessment
   - Tracking ID assigned

2. **Triage** (1-3 days)
   - Security team reproduces issue
   - Severity confirmed or adjusted
   - Affected versions identified

3. **Fix Development** (varies by severity)
   - Private patch developed
   - Fix tested in isolated environment
   - Backports prepared for supported versions

4. **Coordinated Disclosure** (varies)
   - Agree on disclosure timeline
   - Prepare security advisory
   - CVE requested if applicable

5. **Public Release**
   - Patch released to all supported versions
   - Security advisory published
   - Credit given to reporter (if desired)

### Timeline Expectations

| Severity | Initial Response | Fix Target | Disclosure |
|----------|-----------------|------------|------------|
| P0       | 4 hours         | 1-3 days   | 7 days     |
| P1       | 24 hours        | 7 days     | 30 days    |
| P2       | 3 days          | 30 days    | 60 days    |
| P3       | 7 days          | 90 days    | 90 days    |
