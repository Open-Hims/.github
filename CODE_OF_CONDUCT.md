## Healthcare-Specific Guidelines

Given that OpenHIMS deals with healthcare technology, we have additional expectations:

### Patient Safety First

- All discussions and contributions must prioritize patient safety
- Never suggest shortcuts that compromise security or data integrity
- If you identify a potential patient safety issue, report it immediately through proper channels

### Confidentiality

- **Never share real patient data** (PHI/PII) in issues, pull requests, or discussions
- Use only synthetic or anonymized data for testing and examples
- Report any accidental PHI disclosure immediately to security@openhims.org

### Professional Conduct

- Maintain professional standards appropriate for healthcare technology
- Recognize that our work directly impacts patient care
- Be thorough in testing and documentation
- Acknowledge when you're unsure rather than providing incorrect information

---

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

---

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:

- GitHub repositories (issues, pull requests, discussions)
- Discord server
- Community forum
- Email lists
- Social media accounts
- In-person or virtual events

It also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces, such as using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**conduct@openhims.org**

For security or PHI-related violations, also notify: **security@openhims.org**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### What to Include in a Report

- Your contact information
- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
- Your account of what occurred (including any screenshots or logs)
- Any additional context or information
- Whether you believe this is ongoing

### Confidentiality

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. We will not name harassment victims without their explicit consent.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Special Cases

### Accidental PHI Disclosure

If you accidentally post real patient data:

1. **Immediately delete** the content
2. **Report to security@openhims.org** with details
3. **No penalty** for honest mistakes reported promptly
4. We will work with GitHub/platforms to purge data from history

Deliberately sharing PHI results in immediate permanent ban and may be reported to authorities.

### Security Vulnerabilities

If conduct involves discussion of security vulnerabilities:

- Follow our [Security Policy](./SECURITY.md)
- Responsible disclosure is encouraged and protected
- Malicious exploitation or public disclosure of vulnerabilities is grounds for immediate ban
